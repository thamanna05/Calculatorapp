# Calculatorapp
The libraries i used in making of this calculator is argparse library.
Calucaltorapp performs 4 basic operations(additon,subraction,multiplication and division).
For an user to access the operations, give 2 inputs number1 and number2 and the operation the user want to perform(+,-,*,/).
While making this app, i learnt how argarse library and its commands work.

Steps to run the program:
Step 1: Give 2 inputs --number1 and --number2 and the operation you want to perform, for eg: --operation + for addition!
